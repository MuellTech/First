Night cometh where no man can work.
The Bilble says in the book of Isaiah 40:28
Have though not head, have though not seen that the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth he fainted not neither is he weary for there is no searching of his undestanding.
he said unto them that has no strenght, he giveth might
for young men will be weary and will faint, and the youth will uterlly fall
Buth those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strenght. They will mount up wings like eagle, they will walk and not be weary.
the will run and not faint.
